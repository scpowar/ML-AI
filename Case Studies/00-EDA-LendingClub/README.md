## General Information
- This project is a EDA case study to analyse loan data and find patterns to identify if a customer is likely to default
- Our main objective is to minimise the risk of financial loss while lending money to customer
- Two types of risk:
  1. Likely to repay loan; not approving will cause loss of business
  2. Not likely to repay loan; approving will cause financial loss
- The dataset that is being used is loan dataset

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- 86% customers have fully paid the loan but 14% have been charged off. Default rate is 14%
- Frequency of small businesses defaulting is very high compared to others. Parameters to give loan to small business should be made more stringent in order to avoid financial loss
- Default rate for verified customers is significantly more than that for non verified customers
- Default rate was max in 2007 after which it kept on dropping till 2009. But from 2010 we see a steady rise in default rate
- Customers whose loans are in very high interest rate category have a comparatively higher tendency to default followed by high, medium and lastly low
